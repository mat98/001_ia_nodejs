# AI Integration Project with OpenAI, LangChain, and Pinecone

Welcome to the project repository! The goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of OpenAI APIs into JavaScript and TypeScript applications, using different modes such as text, speech, and image. Additionally, it explores building applications powered by Language Models (LLM) using tools like LangChain, Pinecone, and ChromaDB, as well as techniques like embeddings, vector databases, and specialized queries.

Below, you will find an overview of the implemented functionalities and the topics covered in this project.

## Project Technologies

ðŸ”¹ **JavaScript and TypeScript**: Primary languages for development.

ðŸ”¹ **Node.js**: Execution environment for the applications.

ðŸ”¹ **OpenAI APIs**: For text, speech, and image generation.

ðŸ”¹ **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.

ðŸ”¹ **Pinecone**: Serverless vector database for embeddings.

ðŸ”¹ **ChromaDB**: Local database for storing embeddings.

ðŸ”¹ **Open Source Models**: For translation and audio transcription.
